## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Fluent API" icon="translate">

	</Card>
	<Card title="Multiple types" icon="approve-check-circle">
		Can validate different types of data, such as boolean, string, number, file, and date.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Customizable validation rules" icon="setting">
		You can create your own validation rules or use the built-in ones, depending on your needs. You can also customize the error messages and the validation logic for each rule.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Framework agnostic" icon="rocket">
		Works with any web framework that accepts FormData and SSR, so you donâ€™t have to worry about compatibility issues.
